# Form Combinators with Scala.js

A simple demo of a combinator library for forms, and a client-side implementation.

This is not production-grade, the combinators are still too limited, and the provided renderer has layout issues. Still I think this approach is promising. You can watch the repo for updates.

## Running the demo

In development, build it with `sbt packageJS`, and open `index-dev.html` in a Web browser.

Or build the optimized version with `sbt optimizeJS`, and open `index.html`.
